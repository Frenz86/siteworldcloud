         <p>Robotics Process Automation (RPA) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based Machine Learning (ML) are two distinct technologies.RPA is fundamentally a process improvement technology and is a re-branding of screen automation along with enhancements in functionalities. RPA attempts to automate rule based mundane repetitive tasks. Examples include invoice processing, data entry etc. the other hand tries to predict the outcome by identifying patterns in data & information and the algorithm would self-learn over time to improve the prediction. Examples include predicting future demand, predicting customers who are likely to default etc.,Businesses can derive immense value by harnessing the power of both these technologies.</p>
